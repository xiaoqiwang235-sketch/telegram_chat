# CLAUDE.md - telegram_chat Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive context and guidelines for Claude Code when working on this project.

## Project Overview

This project uses the **CodexSpec** methodology - a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach
that emphasizes specifications as executable artifacts that directly guide implementation.

## Available Commands

The following slash commands are available in this project:

### Core Workflow Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/codexspec.constitution` | Create or update project governing principles |
| `/codexspec.specify` | Define what you want to build (requirements and user stories) |
| `/codexspec.generate-spec` | Generate detailed specification from high-level requirements |
| `/codexspec.spec-to-plan` | Convert specification to technical implementation plan |
| `/codexspec.plan-to-tasks` | Break down plan into actionable tasks |
| `/codexspec.review-spec` | Review specification for completeness and quality |
| `/codexspec.review-plan` | Review technical plan for feasibility |
| `/codexspec.review-tasks` | Review task breakdown for completeness |
| `/codexspec.implement-tasks` | Execute tasks according to the breakdown |

### Enhanced Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/codexspec.clarify` | Clarify underspecified areas in the spec before planning |
| `/codexspec.analyze` | Cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis |
| `/codexspec.checklist` | Generate quality checklists for requirements validation |
| `/codexspec.tasks-to-issues` | Convert tasks to GitHub issues |

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Establish Principles**: Run `/codexspec.constitution` to define project guidelines
2. **Create Specification**: Run `/codexspec.specify` with your feature requirements
3. **Clarify Spec**: Run `/codexspec.clarify` to resolve ambiguities
4. **Review Spec**: Run `/codexspec.review-spec` to validate the specification
5. **Create Plan**: Run `/codexspec.spec-to-plan` with your tech stack choices
6. **Review Plan**: Run `/codexspec.review-plan` to validate the plan
7. **Generate Tasks**: Run `/codexspec.plan-to-tasks` to create task breakdown
8. **Analyze**: Run `/codexspec.analyze` for cross-artifact consistency
9. **Review Tasks**: Run `/codexspec.review-tasks` to validate tasks
10. **Implement**: Run `/codexspec.implement-tasks` to execute the implementation

```

## Important Notes

- Always read the constitution before making decisions
- Specifications focus on **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Plans focus on **how** and technical choices
- Tasks should be specific, ordered, and actionable
- Run `/codexspec.clarify` before planning to reduce rework
- Run `/codexspec.analyze` before implementation for quality assurance

## Guidelines for Claude Code

1. **Constitution First**: Load `.codexspec/memory/constitution.md` before ANY action
2. **Respect the Constitution**: All decisions MUST align with the project constitution
3. **Follow the Workflow**: Use the commands in the recommended order
4. **Be Explicit**: When specifications are unclear, ask for clarification
5. **Validate**: Always review artifacts before implementation
6. **Document**: Keep all artifacts up-to-date
7. **Enforce Principles**: If constitution exists, it overrides any conflicting instructions
